# MAPA-FRONT-END

# Adopt a Friend

Site developed for the MAPA activity of the Front-End course (3rd semester of college).

## üìÑ Technical Report ‚Äì Project ‚ÄúAdopt a Friend‚Äù

### 1. Introduction
The ‚ÄúAdopt a Friend‚Äù project was developed as part of the Front-End Programming course, with the goal of creating a responsive and interactive website to promote dogs for adoption.  
The site aims to provide a pleasant user experience, making navigation, viewing animals, and contacting the responsible team easy.

### 2. Site Architecture
The website was structured following the separation of concerns pattern:
- **HTML**: Semantic structure of the pages, using appropriate tags for navigation, sections, cards, and forms.
- **CSS**: Visual styling, responsiveness, highlight effects, and the image carousel layout.
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity, DOM manipulation, form validation, image carousel, and responsive menu.

The architecture supports maintainability and scalability, allowing the addition of new features without major impacts on existing code.

### 3. Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Semantic and accessible content structuring.
- **CSS3**: Flexbox for layout, media queries for responsiveness, transition effects, and shadowing.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Event handling, form validation, image carousel, mobile menu, and smooth navigation effects.
- **VS Code**: Development environment.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Assistance in writing and reviewing code.

### 4. Design Choices
- **Responsive Layout**: Use of Flexbox and media queries to ensure a good experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Image Carousel**: Allows users to view featured dog photos, with arrow navigation and a close button.
- **Mobile Menu**: Hamburger menu to facilitate navigation on small screens.
- **Form Validation**: Immediate user feedback, preventing the submission of invalid data.
- **Accessibility**: Use of contrasting colors, large buttons, and keyboard navigation in the carousel.

### 5. Challenges Faced
- **Carousel Responsiveness**: Adjusting the size and positioning of carousel elements for different screen sizes, ensuring buttons and images do not overlap. This was the most difficult part!
- **Close Button Overlap**: It was necessary to adjust the positioning and background of the ‚ÄúClose‚Äù button so it would not invade the image area, especially on mobile devices.
- **Form Validation**: Implementation of clear messages and visual feedback for the user.
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring all features were keyboard accessible and that color contrast was sufficient.

### 6. Application of Course Concepts
The project applies the main concepts studied in Front-End Programming:
- **Semantic Structuring**: Correct use of HTML tags to improve SEO and accessibility.
- **Advanced Styling**: Use of Flexbox, transitions, shadows, and responsiveness.
- **Interactivity**: DOM manipulation, events, and user feedback.
- **Best Practices**: Separation of concerns, clean and commented code, use of variables and reusable functions.

### 7. Final Considerations
The ‚ÄúAdopt a Friend‚Äù website demonstrates the integration of fundamental front-end concepts, providing a pleasant, accessible, and functional experience.  
The project is ready to be expanded with new features and functionalities, such as search filters, animal registration, and integration with external APIs.git
